He followed with a pair of number one full-lengths, Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight (2016) and Astroworld (2018), all the while assisting in platinum singles headlined by the likes of Rihanna (\"Bitch Better Have My Money\"), SZA (\"Love Galore\"), and Drake (\"Portland\"), and working extensively with Quavo as Huncho Jack. Whether leading or supporting, Scott's presence was unmistakable, almost always colored with an array of ad-lib trills including but not limited to \"It's lit,\" \"Yeah, yeah,\" and \"Straight up.\" Along with a collaborative 2019 album with his label collective Jackboys, Scott released the back-to-back 2021 singles \"Escape\" and \"Mafia.\""
